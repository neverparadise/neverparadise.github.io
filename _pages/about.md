Hello, I'm passionate about reinforcement learning and neural networks. My research goal is to develop a general agent capable of solving a wide range of real-world problems and adapting to new tasks. Currently, I work as a research engineer at LG Electronics. Prior to joining LG, I was a master's student at Korea University, where I was supervised by Prof. Changhee Joo.
