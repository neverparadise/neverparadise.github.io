Hello, I'm passionate about reinforcement learning and neural networks. My primary research goal is to develop **massively scalable RL algorithms** and **a general-purpose agent for robotics** which is capable of solving a wide range of real-world problems. Ultimately I aim to enable this versatile agent to adapt new tasks throughout its lifetime.  Currently, I work as a research engineer at LG Electronics. Prior to joining LGE, I was a master's student at Korea University, where I was supervised by Prof. Changhee Joo.  
  
What constitutes a general and adaptive RL agent? I believe it will be based on the integration of various research areas. For example, I think methods for continual reinforcement learning, new types of adaptive neural networks, and innovative learning algorithms are required. I will explore these areas during future Ph.D. program.
